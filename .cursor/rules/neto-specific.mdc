# NETo Application Context

⚠️ **CONTEXT**: You are now working in the `neto/` submodule - the SwiftUI application.

## Repository Context
- **Independent Repository**: This is a separate git repository from the main project
- **Remote**: https://github.com/lab22poland/neto.git
- **Purpose**: Multiplatform SwiftUI application for network engineers

## Development Focus
- **Primary Platforms**: iOS, iPadOS, macOS
- **Core Technology**: SwiftUI with SwiftData persistence
- **Network Tools**: Focus on network engineering utilities

## File Structure Awareness
When working in this directory:
- `neto/` contains the main SwiftUI app source code
- `netoTests/` contains unit tests
- `netoUITests/` contains UI tests
- `neto.xcodeproj/` is the Xcode project file

## Git Operations
- Git commands in this directory operate on the neto submodule repository
- This repository uses `main` branch (never `master`)
- Independent development and versioning from parent project
